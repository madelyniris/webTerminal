       <bold>Hidden Gems Travel App</bold> helps you find off-the-beaten-path tourist destinations that fit your needs and location. <br>
        When traveling, we desire to see the lesser known parts of the world. If we're in New York we want to see the now-renovated fancy bar that once housed a legendary night club - not the Statue of Liberty! <br>
        We want to find that great hiking trail near our motel in Peoria, not the fastest route to Navy Pier. <br>
        Hidden Gems brings those experiences to your fingertips.<br>

        Hidden Gems searches near your location for user-submitted sights and experiences that fit your needs. <br>
        With filtering based on activity type, age/family friendliness, accessibility and cost filters you can be sure you will find the best and most relevant travel activities every time you log in to our app. <br>
        You can also befriend other users on the platform to stay on top of their latest and greatest adventures.<br>
